# Freeside Corporate Code of Conduct

1. When possible, refer all matters to committees, for "further study and
   consideration." Attempt to make the committees as large as possible - never
   less than five.
2. Bring up irrelevant issues as frequently as possible.
3. Misunderstand orders. Ask endless questions or engage in long correspondence
   about such orders. Quibble over them when you can.
4. Haggle over precise wordings of communications, minutes, resolutions.
5. Be unreasonable and urge your fellow-conferees to be "reasonable" and avoid
   haste which might result in embarrassments or difficulties later on.
6. Don't order new working materials until your current stocks have been
   virtually exhausted, so that the slightest delay in filling your order will
   mean a shutdown.
7. To lower morale and with it, production, be pleasant to inefficient workers;
   give undeserved promotions. Discriminate against efficient workers; complain
   unjustly about their work.
8. Fill out forms illegibly so that they will have to be done over; make
   mistakes or omit requested information in forms.
9. Spread disturbing rumors that sound like inside dope.
